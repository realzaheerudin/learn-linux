## Question 1 (50 Marks)

The objective is to draw up five tables, one for each type of test data, showing the following:

| Program name | Original File size (bytes) | Compressed file size (bytes) | Compression ratio % | Comments |
|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|----------|
| huffcode     |                            |                              |                     |          |
| NTFS         |                            |                              |                     |          |
| etc.         |                            |                              |                     |          |



The programs to use are listed on Moodle.

Calculate the ratio as (compressed size) / (original size). The easiest way to do this will be to set up a spreadsheet to do the calculation for you. If a program reports the compression ratio, make sure it is defined in the same way. If you notice anything interesting, put in a comment about it.                                /mnt/third      ext4    500M  10M   490M  2% /mnt/third

## Question 2
Using the Linux time(1) command, compare the compression and decompression speeds of gzip, zstd, and huffcode for each of the five test data files. Put your results in 5 tables, one for each data type. Upload the spreadsheet.
